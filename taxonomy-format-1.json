Thus, if you want to avoid being placed in our database in the future, and avoid having your data \u201csold\u201d to marketers, then you should exercise your \u201copt out\u201d rights, described in section A above and on our \u201cDo Not Sell My Personal Information\u201d page: we will then maintain your information on a suppression list, to \u201csuppress\u201d your data if we later acquire it. Also note that when we \u201cdelete\u201d your information (e.g., if you are a former customer of ours), we may (and are permitted to) retain personal information for certain important purposes, such as (a) to ensure your deleted information is not reintroduced to our systems, (b) to protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (c) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality (such as debugging purposes), (d) as necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (e) to comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (f) for scientific or historical research, (g) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations."

Online targeting, for example: Creating or helping to create defined audience segments based on common demographics and/or shared (actual or inferred) interests or preferences (e.g., households with prospective students). When we do this, we work with a data partner that \u201cmatches\u201d our or other Information through de-identification techniques (such as through coded data \u201chashing\u201d) with online cookies and other identifiers, in order to target and measure ad campaigns online across various display, mobile and other media channels.

                        "What data do we collect and how do we use it. Semasio collects and stores so-called online identifiers relating to internet users (\u201cCookie IDs\u201d or the mobile advertising identifiers IDFA or Google AdID) and the URL addresses of websites connected to one of our data providers if an internet user visits that page or uses an application. We do not store any personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) like names, mail addresses, email addresses, or telephone numbers (though some of the information we collect may be considered \u201cpersonal information\u201d under applicable law in some jurisdictions). In particular, we only extract country-level information and do not store any IP addresses of devices used by internet users to access the Internet. We cannot combine information to gather PII beyond the cookie ID.  Semasio uses this information to enable our customers to perform targeted online marketing campaigns via real-time bidding platforms. Lists of cookie IDs are sent via our data centers to real-time bidding platforms to deliver advertising campaigns to relevant users. We do not use the data for automated decision-making or profiling activities. In some cases, we transfer information to partners that are located outside of the European Union. For this, we have special contractual measures in place to ensure an adequate level of protection for your data. Semasio may identify the devices that are likely to be associated with you so that ads can be targeted, capped and sequenced across those devices. For example, cross-device matching helps us NOT show you ads for the shoes you were looking at on your phone but that you already purchased on your tablet. Instead we\u2019ll try to show you ads for an upcoming triathlon where you can put those shoes to work. It also helps us match devices so we can honor your opt-out choices across all devices we know are connected to the opted-out cookie. However, potentially not all devices or browsers associated with you can be matched by Semasio. Therefore your opt-out choice might have to be performed per device or browser. Data might be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area. Where a transfer of personal data to third countries is taking place this happens only to countries in which the EU Commission has confirmed an adequate level of protection or where Semasio can ensure the careful handling of personal data by means of contractual agreements or other suitable guarantees, such as certifications or proven compliance with international security standards. In addition, we process contact data as well as the correspondence with and billing details of our existing and prospective customers. This data is collected via email and through other channels such as the contact form on our website. This data might be shared with web hosting and web development providers, with customer support software providers, with e-mail software providers, with CRM system providers and with cloud service providers.

We sometimes use or receive information that identifies people by name, address, or email, along with information about those people\u2019s likely preferences, interests, or demographics. An example of this would be if we know that John Smith owns a home in a particular suburb, and is 53 years old. We obtain this data ourselves and through data licensors, and its source may be, for instance, census bureau data, public records, or data aggregators that collect or receive information from consumers, websites, or business transactions. Passively Collected Information and Identifiers. This is information that we or our business partners collect passively through websites or mobile devices (or other devices) including cookie IDs, Apple mobile IDFA identifiers and Android mobile Advertising IDs, or unique identifiers tied to those identifiers. These identifiers generally identify or are linked to particular browsers and devices. We refer to all of these identifiers as \u201cUIDs,\u201d and they often are tied to particular browsers and mobile devices (or other devices, such as set-top boxes). (These UIDs in turn may be \u201csynced\u201d or linked across multiple online content providers, ad networks, and other service providers.) We describe these identifiers in more specific detail in Section V, titled Cookies, Pixels, and SDKs That We (or Our Business Partners) Use.\u201d  Sources from which we may obtain this data are data aggregators, mobile applications, and advertising networks. Web and Mobile Log Data. Passively collected information we receive may also include a range of data about web and mobile logs and usage, such as the type of browser or device (or operating system) being used, an IP address (which may be associated with a computer device or a smart TV), a time-stamp, other information about a user\u2019s device or browser, and information about whether and how a user viewed an ad or interacted with content or visited a particular website (sometimes referred to as \u201cclickstream data\u201d).  Sources from which we may obtain this data are data aggregators, mobile applications, and advertising networks. III. How We Use the Data Generally, we use the Service Data we receive and collect in order to provide marketing, advertising, and analytics services to our customers, including various business partners. We describe our services generally below, and additional descriptions may be contained on this website. Data \u201cOnboarding\u201d Services. We use Service Data to help marketers to reach their own \u201cCRM\u201d lists \u2013 their proprietary \u201cfirst party\u201d lists of their current and prospective customers \u2013 or other audiences, through third party display media platforms. We often help marketers reach audiences representing these CRM lists (or other lists) by \u201conboarding\u201d their offline data online for digital advertising purposes such as display advertising. When we do this, we often work with partners that de-identify this data and connect it in de-identified fashion to display media, or other marketing channels. Enabling Cross-Channel Marketing. We may use Service Data to help marketers and other data platforms in \u201ccross-channel\u201d or \u201ccross-device\u201d marketing \u2013 analyzing, locating and creating potential marketing \u201caudiences\u201d through multiple channels, e.g., web and mobile. For instance, we may link Service Data and UIDs to the same user (based on inferences we have made), so that a marketer can find and remarket to their same audiences through web-based, mobile, or other advertising channels. Creating Data Segments. We also use our Service Data to create online, mobile or other consumer audiences, represented by UIDs or personal information grouped together based on common interests or preferences (\u201cData Segments\u201d). These Data Segments may identify a person or, when used online, a unique online identifier, as, for instance, enjoying sports, travel, living in a middle-class neighborhood, or having children. This information may be leveraged by marketers for content personalization to send relevant and desired offers, coupons, and ads to their customers and others. We offer these Data Segments in different forms to marketers wishing to reach customers through online (e.g., web/mobile), email, and offline channels, often working with the types of partners we describe above. Campaign Measurement and Market Research. We sometimes use the Service Data to help marketers measure the effectiveness of display or other media campaigns \u2013 for instance, to determine which types of ads are most likely to be seen, opened, or to lead to purchases, or to perform other market research. Other Campaign and Data Services. We sometimes use our Service Data to provide other data and marketing services, such as verification, data or audience analytics, data modeling, or other services that may be described on this website. Improving Our Products. We may use our Service Data to improve, analyze and develop our own products and to analyze their effectiveness, or to work with a business partner or client to perform similar services.  We also may use the Service Data for security-related or de-bugging purposes."

We may do so, for instance, for analytical purposes, to measure campaigns, or inform future campaigns. We may do so to facilitate the sending of display media, or other requested services.

Do Not Sell My Personal Information: Your Opt-Out Rights Some of our services involve the use of inferred user interests and preferences collected or employed across multiple websites, devices or channels. These services are often referred to as a type of \u201cInterest-Based Advertising\u201d or \u201cIBA,\u201d and we provide a way for consumers to \u201copt-out\u201d of these IBA services. There are several methods by which you may opt-out of our IBA service as described below. Throtle Cookie Opt-Outs, i.e. \u201cDo Not Sell\u201d Requests If you decide to opt-out of our IBA services via this method, we will set an opt-out cookie (or similar technology) on your browser or device, to indicate to us that you have opted out. You may opt-out by clicking here:  https://optout.thrtle.com/optout. We will complete the processing of your opt-out request within 15 days of receipt. Please note that if you browse the web from multiple browsers or devices, you will need to opt-out from each browser and/or device to ensure that we withhold our IBA services on all of them. For the same reason, if you procure a new device, change browsers or delete your Throtle opt-out cookie (or clear all cookies), you will need to perform this opt-out task again. Also note that the opt-out cookie cannot be set if your browser is configured to block third-party cookies. Please note that your choice to use any of our opt-out tools will not affect ads placed by any other organization. Third-Party Cookie Opt-Outs If you would like to opt-out of other third party ad platforms and services (including some that we work with, and may have transferred data to previously), we recommend visiting the opt-out pages offered by the Network Advertising Initiative (the NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance Web Choices Tool  or the Digital Advertising Alliance CCPA Opt Out Tool . Opting out in this way will not prevent you from seeing ads.  It will, however, generally prevent ads that are targeted to inferences made about your preferences based on your activity across websites and over time. Permanent Opt-outs via Mobile Advertising IDs (MAIDs) Apple assigns an \u201cID for Advertising\u201d (IDFA) to each iOS device, and Google assigns an \u201cAdvertising ID\u201d to all Android devices.  Similar to how a cookie is leveraged for IBA on a web browser, these Mobile Advertising IDs (MAIDs) can be used to deliver \u2018cross-app\u2019 advertising ads to mobile applications to help inform your ad preferences. If you would like to opt-out of this advertising, you can generally opt-out through your device \u201csettings.\u201d. Common device settings are as follows: For Apple Devices: Apple users can opt-out of remarketing by enabling a device setting called \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d (LAT), which restricts advertisers from using the IDFA for behavioral advertising. On your iOS or iPadOS device, you can enable Limit Ad Tracking by going to Settings > Privacy > Advertising and turning on Limit Ad Tracking. You may also reset your advertising ID by going to Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Reset advertising ID.  You can reference further details on how to limit ad tracking on your iOS device here: IDFA Opt-Out. For Android Devices: Similar to IDFA for Apple devices, Android users may opt-out of app-based tracking for IBA by opening the Google Settings app on your device, selecting Ads, and then selecting the option to opt-out of intert-based ads. You can learn more about how identifiers on mobile are used for advertising and receive instruction for how to opt-out of mobile advertising on the Google Privacy & Terms Please note that these platforms control how these settings work, so the above may change, at their discretion. Likewise, if your device uses other platforms not described above, you should check the settings for those devices. You may also opt-out of Throtle\u2019s use of Mobile Advertising IDs (MAIDs) set by Android devices via the following link on our webpage:   https://throtle.io/data-privacy-manager/do-not-sell/.  Because Apple does not disclose their IDFA to users, we are not able to establish an opt-out request based on an Apple MAID (IDFA) in our system. MAIDs are device specific, so you must include each mobile device (e.g smart phone, tablet) that you use as part of your opt-out request. We will complete the processing of your opt-out request within 15 days of receipt. We will retain your associated personal information on an internal \u201copt-out\u201d list to prevent further sale of your data in connection with Throtle services. Permanent Opt-outs via IP Address You may opt-out of the use of your IP Address in connection with Throtle services by submitting an opt-out via the following form on the Throtle webpage: https://throtle.io/data-privacy-manager/do-not-sell/. Please note, if you use several IP addresses you must include all of them in your opt-out request. Also note that Throtle will need a name and/or email address to pair with the IP address so we can be thorough in ensuring we opt-out the appropriate identity. We will complete the processing of your opt-out request within 15 days of receipt. Please note that your choice to use any of our opt-out tools will not affect ads placed by any other organization. Permanent Opt-outs via Email Address, Name/Home Address, or Telephone Number You may opt-out of the use of your email address, name/home address, or telephone number in connection with Throtle services by submitting an opt-out via the following form on the Throtle webpage: https://throtle.io/data-privacy-manager/do-not-sell/. Please note, if you use several email addresses you must include all of them in your opt-out request.  Similarly, if you have multiple home addresses or telephone numbers, you must submit opt-outs for each one. We will complete the processing of your opt-out request within 15 days of receipt. If you opt-out, we will retain your hashed email address on an internal \u201copt-out\u201d list to prevent further sale of your data in connection with Throtle services. Please note that opting out of Throtle\u2019s processing of your data does not mean that online advertising will be blocked altogether or that you will see fewer ads. It simply means that the ads that you see will not be personalized for you. Ads may be served because they relate to the website you are visiting or to your current search, or they may just be randomly placed. Please note that your choice to use any of our opt-out tools will not affect ads placed by any other organization.",

Marketers may use these Data Segments to tailor more relevant ads and offers to groups of users, or to learn more about their own customers and improve their own databases.\n\n\nWe provide other data services, such as (but not limited to) verification, record look-ups, B2B records and services, and other analytics and database tools.\n\nThe above is not necessarily an exclusive description of the ways we may employ Personal Information and other data. Generally, however, by permitting marketers to reference Personal Information and other data when they send offers to their customers and others, we do so to help increase the likelihood that marketers will send relevant and desired, rather than unwanted offers, content, coupons and ads.\n"

We may, in such situations, seek to identify which informational items are required and which are optional. Personal Information We Passively Collect When visitors use the Services, we passively collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which links were 'clicked'. Collecting such information involves the collection and logging of IP addresses, MAC address, operating system, device type, mobile ad identifiers, browsing history, search history and information regarding an individuals interaction with an internet website, application or advertisement, Internet Service Provider (ISP) and browser software used by each user of the Services. In some instances, we may collect geo-location based information for the purpose of helping identify jobs in your area. The information we collect helps us identify the most popular areas of the Sites and determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities. In addition, we may disclose some of this information to advertisers to inform them of the number of people who have viewed and/or clicked their advertisements. Mobile Applications: On mobile applications, we use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Services on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregate usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. On mobile applications, we may send push notifications to your device. You may opt-out of these at the device level. You may opt out of location based services by editing the setting at the device level. Searchable Profiles - In the past, job seekers may have elected to make their profile searchable by our customers on a confidential basis only. Dice no longer offers this feature for job seekers, but for those job seekers who had previously registered on this basis, the user's name and contact information will not be displayed to customers performing searches on the Website. If the customer desires to contact the confidential job seeker regarding an employment opportunity, they will send an email to the job seeker through our system. We will forward the email to the seeker's email address. The seeker's email address will not be provided directly to the customer. When posting a resume confidentially, it is the job seeker's responsibility to ensure that their contact information is not included within their resume attachment. Children and Minors - Dice Services are not available to children under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16 years of age.",
                        "How we use the information we gather. Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways we use the information we gather. Dice encourages all third parties involved, including but not limited to its advertisers, to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our visitors and users and to otherwise handle personal information in a responsible manner. Nevertheless, in the event you encounter any third party associated with, or who claims association with, Dice who you feel is improperly collecting or using information about you, please contact privacy@dice.com. We\u2019ve implemented and maintain a framework consistent with applicable law and this policy for transfers of information outside the country of collection. For example, when we transfer personal data collected in the European Union to locations outside the European Economic Area, we rely on transfer mechanisms adopted by the European Commission to help establish adequate safeguards, including Standard Contractual Clauses. We may also need to transfer your information to provide services to you in accordance with our existing agreements with you, such as the Terms of Service. Dice relies on legitimate interest to process or use your personal data as described above. If you do not agree with this approach, you may object against Dice's processing or use of your personal data as set out below. How we use passively collected information: We use information collected passively, as identified above, in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful Services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our visitors and users, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Services. We may provide statistical information based on this data to advertisers, users, and other current and potential business partners. We may also use the aggregate data to inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked through links to their sites. How we use personal information: We may use the personal information a user submits for the following purposes: To understand a user's needs and create content that is relevant to the user; To generate statistical studies; To conduct market research and planning by sending user surveys; To notify user referrals of Dice services, information, or products when a user requests that Dice send such information to referrals; To improve services, information, and products; To help a user complete a transaction, or provide services or customer support to users and to recipients of Dice products; To communicate with the user and with recipients of Dice products and services; To email users about services, information, products and offers from our business partners (and as set forth in section C, How we share information we gather); To personalize the Sites for the user; To notify the user of any changes with the Sites which may affect the user; To enforce terms of use on the Sites; To allow the user to purchase products, access services, or otherwise engage in activities the user selects; To allow us to contact you by phone, email and/or social media. In some cases, this includes text messaging or alerts and carrier charges may apply; To provide, support, personalize, and develop our website, applications, and product or service offerings; To create, maintain, customize, service, and secure your account with us; To audit our interactions with you, such as counting impressions or verifying the quality and effectiveness of content including ads; To prevent malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, and participating in any prosecution or enforcement of laws or agreements meant to prevent or punish such activity; To maintain the safety, security, and integrity of our website, applications, products and services, databases and other technology assets, and our business, including the detection of security incidents; To debug, identify, or repair errors or effectuate similar functional enhancements; To develop, improve, and deliver marketing and advertising; For internal uses such as research, analytics, development, audits, account management and security; For legal and operational compliance purposes, such as monitoring whether our operations are effectively implementing this policy; To engage in or enable internal uses consisted with our relationship with you, or compatible with the context in which you provided the information, such as internal research for technology development; and For any other purpose described to you when collecting your personal information before or at the time of collection. Blogs, Forums, and Survey Results. User names, identifications ('IDs'), and email addresses (as well as any additional information that a user may choose to post) may be publicly available on the Sites when a user voluntarily and publicly discloses personal information, such as when a user uses features to send a message to another user, or as part of a message posted to a public forum or a publicly-released software application. Users may not be able to change or remove public postings once posted. Any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from these pages, contact us at privacy@dice.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. With respect to surveys, in the event that responses are publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take the survey. Circumstances under which Dice would publicly disclose information collected from surveys include, but are not limited to, sharing survey results with the Sites' users, providing data to Dice advertisers on user preferences and/or demographics, and publicizing overall usage data in press communications. Where surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where Dice advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, Dice reserves the right to disclose any information provided by users, provided that no personal information identifying a specific user is disclosed. Participation in surveys is at a user's option; Dice does not conduct mandatory surveys."

                        "How we share information we gather. Sharing with Service Providers. Subject to the foregoing, Dice uses your personal information in several ways. Dice may share your personal information with service providers to help us with our business activities such as processing credit cards, email and social network marketing, offering customer service, or operating a community forum. These service providers are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. Sharing with Our Customers. With respect to job applications, Dice will not disclose your profile or resume on our Sites to prospective employers without your consent or to carry out your instructions. Job seekers should post profiles and resumes on our Sites only if they wish such information to be viewed by our customers. At any time, job seekers may elect that their profile and resume not be searchable by our customers by logging into their account and changing the status of their profile or, if that is not possible, they may contact us at support@dice.com and we will make the change for them. Sharing with Third Parties and Marketing Preferences. If you opt in to receive promotional materials from third parties, information you have made available to us may be made available to third parties who provide goods or services that we believe may be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving such materials at any time in a variety of ways: by using the opt-out link included in each email, by changing your subscriptions preferences on the user settings page in your Dice account or by contacting us at privacy@dice.com. If you have provided more than one email address to our service, you may continue to be contacted, unless you request to unsubscribe each email address you have provided. If you opted in to receive information directly from third parties, then you must contact those third parties directly to opt-out. In order to effectively tailor our services, these Sites may share your personal information to third party consultants and business partners, including, but not limited to other lead generation companies (collectively 'Third Party Contractors') to collect, compile, organize, and market to you related services. When you submit any personal information on this Site, we will obtain your consent authorizing the Sites to share with Third Party Contractors any and all personal information that is necessary to enable additional service offerings. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact us at privacy@dice.com. Sharing for Other Purposes. Please note that Dice reserves the right to disclose information submitted by or concerning any visitor or user as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems or business. We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request; for example in response to a court order or a subpoena, or in response to a law enforcement or government agency's request. We also may disclose such information to third parties: (i) in connection with prevention of fraud, deception, or other malicious activities, (ii) where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, (iii) in situations that may involve violations of our terms of use or other rules, (iv) to protect our rights and the rights and safety of others, and (v) as otherwise required by law. We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our servers or Services for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution, or to suspend or terminate your use of the Services in connection with any suspected illegal or infringing activity or if you are in violation of our Terms of Use Agreement or other published guidelines. If Dice is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. Dice reserves the right to assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party your personal information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of any portion or all of Dice's or its affiliated entities' assets or stock. We may disclose personal information to third parties to whom you or your authorized representatives direct us to disclose your personal information.  We may disclose personal information to other parties identified by you when collecting your personal information before or at the time of collection, or to which you separately consented. Framing and Co-Branding. The Sites may utilize framing and masking techniques to make it appear that the user is still on the Site when the user is actually on a third-party website. We also have co-branding relationships with certain partners. In these relationships, you will notice our service platform on our partner's page. In this situation, both parties are collecting your data and both privacy policies govern the data collected. We will not share your data with third parties without your consent in these and other relationships. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Sites and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects personal information."

We do not associate that identifier with your name, email, address, or phone number, because we don\u2019t collect that type of directly identifying information about consumers.\n               Mobile Advertising ID \n               The Mobile Advertising ID, also referred to as a MAID, is a string of digits associated with a mobile device assigned by operating systems like Android and Apple IOS. This is unique to your device and can be reset by the user.  Android identifiers include the Google advertising identifier (GAID), and iOS identifiers include the ID For Advertising (IDFA). These are associated with your browser or device and are used as described in the \u2018How your personal data will be used by us\u2019 section below\u201d\n               IDFV\n               The ID for Vendors (IDFV) is a code assigned to all apps by one developer and is shared across all apps by that developer on your Apple IOS device.\n               Cookie ID  \n               This is a unique identifier made up of a string of characters that websites and servers associate with the browser on which the cookie is stored. It is used for purposes including frequency capping and measurement. We may also receive anonymised IDs based on, e.g. SSP-deployed cookies, which may have been synced with other third-party cookies, and that are de-identified and shared with us.  This cookie syncing process allows the parties to map their respective cookie information (for example, if SSP ABC sets a cookie on a user\u2019s device with an ID 54321 and Blis sets a cookie on the same user\u2019s device with an ID 67890, cookie synching would enable SSP ABC and Blis to recognise that ID 54321 and ID 67890 relate to the same user\u2019s device). This cookie sync may influence Blis\u2019 decisions to bid on advertising opportunities and to retarget users with different advertising opportunities.\n               Cross-Device ID \n               This ID is a user ID created by using statistical, deterministic and probabilistic algorithms in an attempt to link devices and identifiers belonging to the same user. This is often a Cookie-based ID.\n               We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:\n               Location related data \n               This includes precise GPS-sourced latitude/longitude data and geolocation data derived from IP addresses. We may also create historic location data profiles from this data. For IP addresses that we have identified as residential, we may link devices seen at the IP address as being potentially in the same household.\n               Online usage data or \u201clog\u201d data\n               This includes some data which would be defined as personal data and some which is not. The following is a non-exhaustive list: the name of the publisher or app in use, the category of the site, the general nature of the content being viewed e.g. sports, other information from advertising bid requests relating to a particular device ID, such as hashed cookie IDs or proprietary client/partner IDs, user agent information, device make, model and operating system, ads clicked on, frequency of exposure to ads served, IP address and timezone. \n               Inferred data \n               We might infer some data about you based on your demographics (e.g., age or gender), browsing behaviour or your location data.  For example, if you regularly go to a sports stadium, we might predict that you are interested in sports, and then show you an ad from one of our clients that sells sporting fashion goods.  To be more precise, we would predict that your device might belong to a person interested in sports."

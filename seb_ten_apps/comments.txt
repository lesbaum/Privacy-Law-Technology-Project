This document includes comments about each privacy policies.
This includes reasons for blank statements in the JSON to other additional information
that I thought would be important to know


Path of Giants (Journey Games)
    -These guys state they do not collect data from children under the age of 13 so
    I left the rt6 blank
    
    -No actual names provied, but they include an email and physical address (because I assume their
    support team is quite large)

wollstonecraft (hololabs studio inc)
    -Super small privacy policy. They say they do not collect information from children and adults but note 
    that "anonymous information may be shared with third parties to help us run and maintain our services."

    -I added the questions section in their privacy policy to rt8.
    Even though it is not guide, it does give an option where you can ask about stuff.

Prodigy (prodigy) 
    - for rt5 I added that specific line because they use student and child in a weird way. They do 
    differentiate children and student in one section, but don't say much about that. Since they categorize their users
    into three categories (teachers, students, and parents) I assume that students can also be children and 
    anything they say about student data can also be said about childrens data.

    -for rt6, there are actually three bulletpoints, but I only included the first one due to the length of content

Balloon Crush
    -They do specifically state that they do not collect from children, but there is a 
    portion where it basically says yo we got some third party stuff and we have no control and take no 
    responsibility for their practices which is a bit weird. I put a small bit in the rt6 section. By far the most sus out of
    the ones I have done so far.

Crescent Moon Games
    -They also have a similar third party warning in their privacy policy. This is also the 
    first policy that has been on a word doc out of the ten I have received. They say for users in general, they 
    strive to keep personal information safe using commercially acceptable means, but also note that the internet is not 100% secure and safeso no guarentees.

Adventure Academy
    -One thing I wasnt sure of was whether or not to add their PO box in the physical address section in rt3. I did anyways just in case.

Animal Jam
    -Another PO box address one. Also these guys list all the third parties they collab with which was quite intersting.

IDZ Digital
    -First one I think I have enocountered from a different hosting country. Pretty short policy (done in php)

Infinity Games
    -These guys do not provide a physical address. THey also aren't really specific on a way to delete data.

Entertainment One  
    -By far one of the more complete privacy poilicies I have read. They go display 
    all the ways they use childrens information that I could not fit into this model.
    Children privacy policy is the first thing listed on their privacy policy document which was quite nice to see.
